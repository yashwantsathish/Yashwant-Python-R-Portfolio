For my Knowledge Discovery from Data class (Intro to Machine Learning), I worked with a team to reimagine NBA player categorizations using clustering techniques. The traditional five-position model (Point Guard, Shooting Guard, Small Forward, Power Forward, Center) has become less representative of players' roles in modern basketball. To address this, we applied K-Means Clustering to classify players based on their playstyles, utilizing advanced and rate-adjusted statistics from the nbastatR library.

Our primary objective was to create a more accurate and intuitive classification system for NBA players that reflects their actual contributions on the court. By clustering players into roles rather than positions, we aimed to provide a tool that could be useful for both coaching staff and fans.
