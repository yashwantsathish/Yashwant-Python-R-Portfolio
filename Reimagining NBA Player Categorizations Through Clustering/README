For my Knowledge Discovery from Data class (Intro to Machine Learning), I worked with a team to reimagine NBA player categorizations using clustering techniques. The traditional five-position model (Point Guard, Shooting Guard, Small Forward, Power Forward, Center) has become less representative of players' roles in modern basketball. To address this, we applied K-Means Clustering to classify players based on their playstyles, utilizing advanced and rate-adjusted statistics from the nbastatR library.
